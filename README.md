# 🎓 Academic Database Migration Project

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project showcases the modernization of a comprehensive academic management system through schema redesign and database migration. Built for institutions aiming to streamline student, faculty, course, and infrastructure data, this system integrates multiple modules into a unified relational database.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Migrate legacy data and structure from Oracle to PostgreSQL (or vice versa) while preserving referential integrity.
- Refactor schemas for improved normalization, scalability, and performance.
- Showcase stored procedures, constraints, and automation scripts for real-world academic workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Database Engines**: Oracle SQL & PostgreSQL
- **Languages**: SQL, PL/SQL, pgSQL
- **Version Control**: Git / GitHub
- **Tools**: SQL Developer, pgAdmin, ERD tools (dbdiagram.io, draw.io)

## 🧱 Key Modules
- **Admissions**: Student registration, notes, department linking.
- **Academics**: Courses, prerequisites, offerings, exams, grades, schedules.
- **Faculty & Departments**: Staff hiring, profiles, academic roles.
- **Hostel**: Room allocations, capacity, preferences.
- **Library**: Book tracking, loans, condition notes.
- **Finance**: Student fees, scholarships, payments.
- **Communication**: System notifications between faculty and students.
- **Behavior & Attendance**: Disciplinary actions, attendance tracking.

## 📦 Structure & Features
- Detailed `CREATE TABLE` statements with relational integrity.
- Use of advanced datatypes (`CLOB`, `DATE`, `VARCHAR2`, etc.).
- Embedded business logic (e.g. attendance, results, notifications).
- Migration simulations between platforms.
- Stored procedures for automated GPA calculation, fee alerts, etc.
